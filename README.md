## About

From the original [repo](https://github.com/wheredoesyourmindgo/nushu-vscode-theme):

> Nushu (this theme) is a fork of the VSCode GitHub theme, specifically the GitHub Light Default and GitHub Dark Default themes. This theme uses alternative background colors that effectively reduce overall contrast. It uses the same Primer palette as the GitHub Default themes for syntax, so both the Light and Dark variants should seem "familiar".
